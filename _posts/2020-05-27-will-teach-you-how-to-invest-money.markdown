  title="8) Invest like a boss"
  content="This is a podcast for “serious” investors – the major difference is that unlike other podcasts that offer a general view on investment, this is more niche-focused. The show takes an outside the box look on the most intricate investment plans and how investors can get from ground zero to the top. Hosted by entrepreneur and angel investor Sam Marks and entrepreneur Johnny FD. It is highly recommended for any entrepreneur trying to break into a highly niched financial world."
