<p>In an ever-changing world, businesses are always looking for ways to get ahead of the competition – either through more established traditional means or new innovative ways.</p>

<p>One of those "new innovative ways” is podcasting.  How does podcasting help grow my business? We have listed out a few ways incorporating podcasts into your business can help you and your business grow.</p>

<br>
<h2>Traffic Generation</h2>

<p>If your business is struggling to get customers, then having a podcast can help you substantially. If done properly the impact can be as massive as advert placement on public radios. The great thing about your audience is that they are already interested in things surrounding your business (the reason why they are listening to your podcast, in the first place), so they need little or no push to check out your business.  So uttering a quick word about your business during an episode - can easily lead to outstanding results.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>When you talk about business and how to grow it, one familiar word that you will come across is networking. In today's world there is a belief that a good network makes it faster for you to achieve your goal – but how do you network using a podcast. </p>

<p>It is no secret that a lot of people like getting interviewed, for a variety of reasons- most especially because it allows them to push their brand. With a podcast you have a platform on which people can take advantage of – you can invite them to speak on your show. Also, you might be asked for a collaboration. All these build your network, which translates into your business.</p>

<h2>Project Yourself As An Authority</h2>

<p>In the process of building your podcast,  the end goal should be making your voice one of the established ones in your business industry. While this sounds great, it involves putting in a lot of work – some ways you can achieve this is by sharing a valuable piece of information in each episode, working with people who are considered to be industry experts – when you share your mic with other authorities, you are most likely to be seen as one. When your clients see that you are an authority in a business, they are going to be more confident with your products.</p>

<br>
<h2>Revenue Stream</h2>

<p>One great thing about having a podcast is that unlike most ways in which you try to carry your business to your audience - it can be monetised. Meaning you get money for advertising your business. Having a podcast can serve as an extra stream of income while subsequently giving your business free traffic generation. The ways to do this include, sponsorship,   other industry affiliate marketing, merchandise, and many more.</p>

<p>With all that said, you can see the undeniable advantages of having a podcast channel. If you are thinking, "I don't have the skill" or " it is an extra expense" – be rest assured that podcasts are neither expensive to set up or hard to learn ( it gets better with time). So why not?</p>
