  title="1) Revisionist History"
  content="The host of this show is no other than Malcolm Gladwell, the author is one of the most loved in the world. His books such as Outliers, Blink, and The tipping points have been a wealth of knowledge to many – in the same vein, his podcast serves as a bank of wisdom. Customary to his style, Gladwell focuses on topics that are likely to be overlooked or misunderstood by the average person. He shines his light on every episode by looking at hidden facts, exposing unlikely angles, and creating paths for listeners to think out of the box."

Just like Revisionist History they also go through a mountain of data to present the facts to their listeners."

  title="4) Intelligence Squared"
  content="If you are tired of the regular format of most podcasts then you should try Intelligence Squared. Different from the rest, it is more of a  standoff – with two teams of two highly qualified professionals debating against each other aided by a moderator and a live audience.  Of the teams, one panel is usually for and the other against  - the subject matter ranges from Ghost Ships and Geopolitics, Deepfakes and the Infocalypse"
