  title="1) Retronauts"
  content="This is one of the few podcasts that has chosen to niche down in the gaming podcast world, to set themselves apart. Retronauts as the name suggests are all about games from the past- according to their slogan, its mission is \"to explore the history of video games, one game at a time.\"  Known for its exceptional quality -  it is meant to show the broad history of video games and how the past game structure influences the present days' games."

  title="2) How Did This Get Played?"
  content="Hosted by Heather Anne Campbell and Nick Wiger, this podcast focuses on the  \"weirdest\"  and \"worst\" games ever created. If you are looking for a light-hearted podcast then this podcast should be your go-to –since, both Heather and Nick are comedians. However, they still incorporate seriousness and point out the mistakes and errors that could have been avoided in games they chose to analyse. An episode goes on for about 1 hour and 15 minutes each."

  title="3) Giant Bombcast"
  content="Arguably one of the biggest and known podcasts in the gaming world, Giant Bombcast is all about what's happening in the gaming verse- the show is hosted by the Giant Bombcast team.  Existing since 2008 and with over 600 episodes, the podcast features interviews, game news, latest releases, and much more.  The team also deviates from the gaming scene and goes a bit more into their personal likes (they do talk about food a lot). Slight warning though, unlike conventional podcasts, this one might take a bit more time to listen to but it is equally enjoyable."

  title="4) What Good Games"
  content="Compared to the other podcast on this list, What Good Games are a relatively new one. Considered by many as a breath of fresh air, as it is hosted by three women (Andrea Rene, Brittney Brombacher, and Kristine Steimer) in what is known as a male-dominated industry. With the three of them having over 30+ years of gaming experience between them, they talk extensively about everything from their favorite games industry news, new consoles, and hardware. A great podcast if you are interested in another perspective of things."
