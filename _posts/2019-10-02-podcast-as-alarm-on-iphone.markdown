<h3>Now you are ready to set yourself up for success</h3>

<p>Wake up early and listen to your favourite show, or sleep easy knowing that you wont miss the latest episode of a gripping drama. Podcast alarm is an alarm clock that plays podcasts!</p>

<p>Search through every podcast available right from within the app and then download any episode. That episode will then be put into an ordered queue. All thats left is to pick a time and date to play that episode. You can even queue up a weeks worth and have them all set at once.</p>

<p>If you know your show won’t release a new episode until late at night, then just subscribe to their show and have the app automatically download it and set the alarm for you. If you like a daily show you could set the alarm once and wake up to it for a whole year!</p>
