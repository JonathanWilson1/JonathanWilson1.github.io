<p>Since podcasting started gaining mainstream attention, content creators both new and old - have suddenly been faced with a new dilemma of what path they should choose in sharing their works with the world.</p>

<p>While in the case of confusion some decide to try both out before settling for one- others are more firm in their decision and pick either podcast or youtube channel head-on. In this article, we will compare both podcasts and youtube using different metrics - to make your decision easier.</p>

<br>
<h2>YouTube CPM vs Podcast CPM</h2>

<p>Before diving into other aspects, we must first consider the possible monetary gains from both platforms. To do this we have to understand what CPM means. Essentially, CPM is an acronym for COST per Mile. Cost Per Mile simply means, how many impressions/visitors you would need to earn a certain amount of money.</p>

<p>Currently, on average you can earn between $2 – $10 on YouTube and $18 – $50 CPM with Podcast. Of course, this depends on several factors including, how long was the video, the content of the video, and demand for those viewers.  In summary, Podcasting has a higher CPM.

<h2>Equipment Needed</h2>

<p>For anyone starting a business or a hobby, you always have to consider the capital required for said business or hobby.  First off,  it is often said that you can start your podcast or youtube channel with just your smartphone, this is 100% true – but as the case usually is – once you start growing, you will look for ways of making your content more appealing. This generally means better equipment. </p>

<p>With a Youtube channel, you tend to spend more money on equipment, because the average "great" camera is far more expensive than the "great" microphone. And of course, you will still need a microphone for youtube channel. Your videos might also need lighting. In essence, while setting up all Youtube you will need Podcast equipment and more. So capital wise, it is better to choose setting up a podcast.</p>

<h2>Personal Test</h2>

<p>If you are considering making a podcast or youtube channel – you have to look in-depth and consider the type of person you are.  Are you comfortable being on camera? Do you have proper interviewing skills? What do you like talking about? Is your content more suitable for podcasts or youtube? By asking these and many more similar questions – you might be able to answer regarding if you should start a podcast or a youtube channel.</p>

<br>
<h2>Audience Test</h2>

<p>After the personal test, it is time to move on to the audience. In today's world, there are so many options and people have different reasons for doing things – if you are going to produce content that requires a lot of visual aid to understand the concepts - then you might be more suited for youtube. If it is content that can be enjoyed while doing other activities like driving, cooking then probably consider a podcast.
</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want to reach people on various platforms then the podcast is your best bet, unlike Youtube that is essentially just a single platform there are so many podcasts platforms such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify and so many others.</p>
