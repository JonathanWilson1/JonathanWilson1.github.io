  content="If you a familiar with the black community then you will know about Reni Eddo- Lodge, the author of Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race, published in 2017 it was one of the best books of the year about racial discrimination. Similar to her thought-provoking book, her podcast is centred on taking the conversation further. It looks into the last decades of anti-racism activism and life as a black person in general. Also, she features key speakers that have been involved in activism just like her. The podcast is a one-off and features only 9 episodes in general but it is still very much valid and thought-provoking."
