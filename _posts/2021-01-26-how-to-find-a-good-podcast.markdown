While some are put together by well-built algorithms, others are done manually by humans – who eat and breathe podcasts.

Then there is the other ads placement that is done everywhere else but usually where the target audience likes to visit. So if you like video games – you are likely to see an advertisement for gaming podcasts on your internet feeds. Most people prefer the in-episode ads because it comes with a sense of reassurance – since it is coming from a podcast you already enjoy.</p>
