<h2>The alarm isn't ringing.</h2>

<p>If you close Podcast Alarm running in the background while in 'silent mode' and 'do not disturb mode', the alarm will not ring. Please make sure 'silent mode' and 'do not disturb mode' are off when you close Podcast Alarm  from the background.</p>


<p>Battery saving mode also prevents alarms from ringing in 'silent mode' and 'do not disturb mode'. If you are using battery saving mode, please ensure that 'silent mode' and 'do not disturb mode' are off.</p>
